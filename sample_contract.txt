to examine the title to the property at Buyer’s own expense and until the earlier of: (i) thirty days from the later of the Requisition Date or the date on which
the conditions in this Agreement are fulfilled or otherwise waived or; (ii) five days prior to completion, to satisfy Buyer that there are no outstanding
work orders or deficiency notices affecting the property, and that its present use (....................................................................................) may
be lawfully continued and that the principal building may be insured against risk of fire. Seller hereby consents to the municipality or other governmental
agencies releasing to Buyer details of all outstanding work orders and deficiency notices affecting the property, and Seller agrees to execute and
deliver such further authorizations in this regard as Buyer may reasonably require.
9. FUTURE USE: Seller and Buyer agree that there is no representation or warranty of any kind that the future intended use of the property by Buyer is
or will be lawful except as may be specifically provided for in this Agreement.
10. TITLE: Provided that the title to the property is good and free from all registered restrictions, charges, liens, and encumbrances except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement and save and except for (a) any registered restrictions or covenants that run with the land providing that such
are complied with; (b) any registered municipal agreements and registered agreements with publicly regulated utilities providing such have been
complied with, or security has been posted to ensure compliance and completion, as evidenced by a letter from the relevant municipality or regulated
utility; (c) any minor easements for the supply of domestic utility or telecommunication services to the property or adjacent properties; and (d) any
easements for drainage, storm or sanitary sewers, public utility lines, telecommunication lines, cable television lines or other services which do not
materially affect the use of the property. If within the specified times referred to in paragraph 8 any valid objection to title or to any outstanding work

risk of fire (Title Insurance) in favour of the Buyer and any mortgagee, (with all related costs at the expense of the Seller), and which Buyer will not
waive, this Agreement notwithstanding any intermediate acts or negotiations in respect of such objections, shall be at an end and all monies paid
shall be returned without interest or deduction and Seller, Listing Brokerage and Co-operating Brokerage shall not be liable for any costs or damages.
Save as to any valid objection so made by such day and except for any objection going to the root of the title, Buyer shall be conclusively deemed to
have accepted Seller’s title to the property.
11. CLOSING ARRANGEMENTS: Where each of the Seller and Buyer retain a lawyer to complete the Agreement of Purchase and Sale of the property,
and where the transaction will be completed by electronic registration pursuant to Part III of the Land Registration Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter
L4 and the Electronic Registration Act, S.O. 1991, Chapter 44, and any amendments thereto, the Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that
the exchange of closing funds, non-registrable documents and other items (the “Requisite Deliveries”) and the release thereof to the Seller and Buyer
will (a) not occur at the same time as the registration of the transfer/deed (and any other documents intended to be registered in connection with the
completion of this transaction) and (b) be subject to conditions whereby the lawyer(s) receiving any of the Requisite Deliveries will be required to hold
same in trust and not release same except in accordance with the terms of a document registration agreement between the said lawyers. The Seller
and Buyer irrevocably instruct the said lawyers to be bound by the document registration agreement which is recommended from time to time by the
Law Society of Ontario. Unless otherwise agreed to by the lawyers, such exchange of Requisite Deliveries shall occur by the delivery of the Requisite
Deliveries of each party to the office of the lawyer for the other party or such other location agreeable to both lawyers.
12. DOCUMENTS AND DISCHARGE: Buyer shall not call for the production of any title deed, abstract, survey or other evidence of title to the property
except such as are in the possession or control of Seller. If requested by Buyer, Seller will deliver any sketch or survey of the property within Seller’s
control to Buyer as soon as possible and prior to the Requisition Date. If a discharge of any Charge/Mortgage held by a corporation incorporated
pursuant to the Trust And Loan Companies Act (Canada), Chartered Bank, Trust Company, Credit Union, Caisse Populaire or Insurance Company
and which is not to be assumed by Buyer on completion, is not available in registrable form on completion, Buyer agrees to accept Seller’s lawyer’s
personal undertaking to obtain, out of the closing funds, a discharge in registrable form and to register same, or cause same to be registered, on
title within a reasonable period of time after completion, provided that on or before completion Seller shall provide to Buyer a mortgage statement
prepared by the mortgagee setting out the balance required to obtain the discharge, and, where a real-time electronic cleared funds transfer system is
not being used, a direction executed by Seller directing payment to the mortgagee of the amount required to obtain the discharge out of the balance
due on completion.
13. INSPECTION: Buyer acknowledges having had the opportunity to inspect the property and understands that upon acceptance of this offer there shall
be a binding agreement of purchase and sale between Buyer and Seller. The Buyer acknowledges having the opportunity to include a
requirement for a property inspection report in this Agreement and agrees that except as may be specifically provided for in
this Agreement, the Buyer will not be obtaining a property inspection or property inspection report regarding the property.
14. INSURANCE: All buildings on the property and all other things being purchased shall be and remain until completion at the risk of Seller. Pending
completion, Seller shall hold all insurance policies, if any, and the proceeds thereof in trust for the parties as their interests may appear and in the
event of substantial damage, Buyer may either terminate this Agreement and have all monies paid returned without interest or deduction or else
take the proceeds of any insurance and complete the purchase. No insurance shall be transferred on completion. If Seller is taking back a Charge/
Mortgage, or Buyer is assuming a Charge/Mortgage, Buyer shall supply Seller with reasonable evidence of adequate insurance to protect Seller’s or
other mortgagee’s interest on completion.
